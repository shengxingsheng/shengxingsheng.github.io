### What is a Harm ? 

Harm means a loss, damage to property, environment, physical or mental injury to personnel and living things, including financial losses, loss of reputation & adverse media coverage.

损害是指对财产、环境的损失、 对人员和生物的身体或精神伤害， 包括经济损失、声誉损失和不利的 媒体报道。

### What is a Risk? 

Risk is a combination of 2 elements, severity and likelihood. The consequences of something going wrong might be anything from a cut finger (Negligible) to death (Extreme). And the likelihood of something going wrong can vary from very unlikely to very likely.

风险是两个 元素的组合，**严重性**和**可能性**。 事情 出错的后果可能是任何事情 从割伤手指（可忽略不计）到 死亡（极端）。 某件事 出错的可能性从非常 不太可能到非常可能。

Incidentally, we tend to focus entirely on risks to people. This is the most straightforward way of illustrating the principles of risk assessment But the approach is also used to assess risks to the company's assets, to its reputation, to the environment, and to financial risks

顺便说一句，我们倾向于完全关注 对人们的风险。 这是说明风险评估原则的最直接的 方式  但该方法也用于 评估公司 资产、声誉、 环境和财务 风险的风险

### perception of risk?

### **Likely hood of harm table (Sample)** 

 Probability Description 

A. Very Unlikely ；Never heard in the shipping industry 

B Unlikely ；Heard of in the shipping industry 

c Possibly； Happens in the shipping industry once per year or happened in the company more than 3 years ago 

D Likely； Happens in the shipping industry more than once per year or in the company  once per year 

E Very Likely ；Happened in the company more than once per year 

###  level of risks

低风险的话啊，只能降低他发生的可能性 , 不能降低后果

### When to do formal Risk Assessment 

Risk is managed by identifying all identifiable hazards, assessing consequences and probabilities correctly and evaluating and implementing prevention and mitigation measures. 

**Risk Assessments** are conducted in order to identify and address potential hazards to  personnel, the environment, property and company's reputation / brand for: 

Day to day Operations 

Critical Operations

 New operations/tasks  

New operations/tasks

Unusual or non-routine jobs
Work on critical equipment
Changes to procedures or equipment
Prior to introduction of new critical equipment or procedures
For preparation of complex or special jobs
Any operation in which there is deviation from procedures

### Who benefits from Formal or Formal Risk Assessment? 

You and your fellow seafarers The ship, your Company, the owners of the cargo you carry and the P&l Club and insurance companies.

Step 1:  identify the hazards 

Step 2: decide who might be harmed and how 

Step 3: evaluate the risks and decide on precautions 

Step 4: apply controls / precautions and do the job.

## 事故报告

### event reporting

在软件bassNet

near miss 也要报告，（差一点就发生事故）

### Near miss reporting



## LTI BBS

FAC (first aid cases)

MTC (medical treatment cases)

RWC (restricted work cases) 

**LTI** (Lost Time Injury cases) - An injury which results in an individual being unable to carry  out any duty or to return to work on the day following the injury unless caused by delays in getting medical treatment ashore. Note: An injury is classified as a "LTi" if the individual is discharged from the ship for medical treatment. These are decided by the ship & reported through the company's SMS system and / or doctor visit reports. LTls have to be documented, disclosed and statistics made available when asked by any one including external agencies.

**LTIF** LTIF ( Lost time injury frequency) In order to compare the LTl records between ships and the fleet of various companies, it is important to know the number of LTls for a uniform number of worked hours available. For example We cannot compare which ship has a better personal safety record in a certain period because each ship has different number of crew working on board in that period. We also cannot compare which company has a better personal safety record in a certain period because each company consists of different number of ships and different number of crew working in that period.

**LTIF**

**We need to reduce them** Be assertive  Encourage a good safety culture on board Avoid unsafe acts & practice BBS (Behaviour Based Safety) Conduct Tool box meetings, conduct Job hazard analysis (Risk assessment) & use the Stop work authority.  Read cosWP (code of safe working practices for merchant seamen) View Safety Movies on board  Learn by others experiences (Fleet reports / feedback reports to discuss during safety / tool-box meetings) to avoid similar injuries on board ships.
