**5. Look at the illustration and say something about the probability of disposal of medium-speed and high-speed diesel engine. (See Fig.2-4)**

When the ship is sailing at full speed, it needs four engines running. When the ship is sailing at half speed, it needs two engines running. When the ship is operating at about 30%of full speed, one engine is enough to meet its power requirement. That is, the ship can be operated with single engine, double engines or four engines according to the load condition. Generally, when the ship is sailing at sea speed, it has four engines running while it approaches the wharf, it has two engines running. 

5 看实图，说说中速机和高速机布置的可能性。

当船在全速航行时，它需要四台机运行。当船在半速航行的时候，它需要两台发动机运行，当船以全速的30%运行的时候，一台发动机足够满足动力要求。也就是，船能根据负荷条件来运行一台发动机，两台发动机或四台发动机。通常，当船在全速航行的时候，它有四台发动机运行，当它接近港口的时候，它有两台发动机运行。

**6. Look at the illustration and say something about structure of the main engine. (See Fig.2-5)**

The structure of the main engine is as follows: the construction mainly includes bedplate, frame, cylinders, pistons, connecting rod, main bearing and crankshaft.

**12. Talk about the working principle of oily water separator according to the picture given. (See Fig.2-10)**

Oily water separators are used to separate oil from bilge water before the latter is pumped overboard.The oily water separator works on the principle of coalescing small oil droplets in the water to form larger oil drops. When the oil drops become large enough, the lower density oil drops floats up and collects at the top of the vessel. The oil layer is pumped into an oily bilge tank which can be pumped out at an oil collecting facility when the ship arrives at a port.

12 通过试图，谈一下油水分离器的工作原理

油水分离器用于在舱底水排放到船外之前，从其里面分离油。油水分离器根据收集在水中小的油滴去构成较大的油滴的原理工作。当油滴变得足够大的时候，低密度的油滴浮上来并在容器的顶部被收集。油层被泵入含油的舱底水舱，当船到达港口时，通过集油设备被泵出。

 

**13. Talk about the anti-pollution equipment on board ship.**

There are some **anti-pollution equipment** on board ship. They are oily water separator, incinerator and sewage treatment system. Oily water separator are used to ensure that ship do not discharge oil when pumping out bilge water or oily water. The incinerator is used to treat the oil sludge and solid waste. Sewage treatment plants are used to treat the sewage water the whole ship produced. All these equipment perform their duties to prevent pollutions from ship to the sea. And we must take great care about them to meet the lowest legislative requirements.

13 谈一下船上的防污设备

在船上有很多防污设备。它们是油水分离器，焚化炉和污水处理装置。油水分离器用于确保船在泵出舱底水或油污水时不排放出油。焚化炉用于处理油渣和固体废弃物。一些处理装置用于处理整艘船的污水。所有的这些设备执行他们的职责防止来自于船的污染进入大海。我们必须注意满足最低的法律要求。

14. Talk about the operation of ballast system.

The ballast system is arranged to draw water from any tank or the sea and discharge it to any other tank or the sea. It is used to ballast or trim the vessel. When transferring ballast water from one tank to another, we must pay much attention. Open the related valves correctly. Close other valves start the pump. Otherwise we could not pump the water. The last but is important, we must ask for the permission from the port authorities before discharge ballast water or we’ll be fined. 

14 谈一下压载系统地运行

压载系统用于排放任何柜中的水以及排放水到任何的柜中和大海中。它用于压载或平衡船。当驳运水从一个柜到另一柜时，我们必须注意。正确打开相关的阀。关闭其他的阀，起动泵。否则我们不能泵送水。最后也是最重要，我们在排放水前必须得到港务局的允许，否则我们将被罚款。

15. Talk about the operation of the bilge system..

The operation of the bilge system is an important daily work, which needs great carefulness. When it is needed, the following procedure must be strictly observed: discharge the bilge tanks one by one; open and close the relevant valves; stop pumping out when the bilge tank is nearly empty; pay attention to the filters and mud-boxes to ensure no logging; the discharge must meet the relative legislative requirement; the operation must be recorded and reported to C/E. The duty engineer should discharge the bilges water before handing over a watch. And relief engineer should check the bilge level when taking over a watch. 

15 谈一下压载系统的运行

压载系统的运行是一项重要的日常工作，需要非常小心。当需要时，一下程序必须被严格执行。一个接一个的排放压载舱。打开和关闭相关的阀。当压载舱快放空的时候停止泵送。注意确保细滤器和泥箱不被堵塞。排放必须满足相关的法律要求。记录操作，并向轮机长报告。值班轮机员在交班之前必须排放舱底水。当接班轮机员在接班时必须检查舱底水位。

**2. Actions to be taken in the event of sudden stoppage of the main engine.**

In the event of sudden stoppage of the main engine, the possible cause may be the safety protection system functioning, due to low lube oil pressure, fuel oil breakdown, blackout, overspeed and so on. Generally, we should take the following actions: first, we will carefully check the main engine and find the causes. Second, we will take measures to remedy the trouble. Third, we will reset and restart the main engine.

2万一主机突然停止，采取的措施

万一主机突然停止，可能是由于低的滑油压力，燃油故障，全船断电，超速使安全保护系统起作用。通常，我们应当采取以下行动：首先，我们仔细检查主机并发现原因。其次。我们采取措施修复故障。第三，我们重新设定并重启主机。

**3. Actions to be taken in the event of the turbocharger surge.**

If the turbocharger surges, the possible causes include high back pressure of exhaust manifold and low flowing quantity, rapid change in load, insufficient fuel oil, bad combustion, scavenge fire and so on. In the event of turbocharger surge, we will slow down the main engine, find the causes, and do some remedies.

3如果涡轮增压器喘震，采取的措施

如果涡轮增压器喘震。可能是由排气总管的高背压和低流量，负载的快速变化，燃油不足，燃烧不良扫气箱着火等引起的。万一涡轮增压器喘震，我们将给主机降速，发现愿意，做一些修复。

**4. Notices to be taken when the main engine running with one cylinder being cut off.**

当主机单缸封缸运行的时候，采取的措施

When the M/E is running with one cylinder being cut off, the M/E speed and load should be reduced to avoid other cylinders becoming overload.
